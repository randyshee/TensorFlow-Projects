# Rethinking Generalization
This project is inspired by "Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization" (arXiv:1611.03530v2) by Zhang et al. And codes are modification from "Laboratory 2: Computer Vision" of MIT 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning.

This project is a reproduction of some of the results from Zhang's research by using MNIST dataset. The accuracy of the test set progresses to zero with randomization of labels whereas the accuracy of the training set remains high.
