## Notable Results:
### 1. Rethinking Generalization <br /> (Reproduction of some of the result from [arXiv:1611.03530v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530v2?utm_campaign=Nick%20Halstead&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) by randomizing the labels of MNIST)

| *Accuracy of the Train and the Test Set at Different Randomization Level* |
